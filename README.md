# K-means-clustering
Machine Learning clustering algorithm
There are 2 files in .py format and each file contains the algorithm of K-Means Clustering. The algorithm has been implemented from scratch and the file 'kmeans.py' contains
the eleborative line of codes of the algorithm.

The second file 'kmeans test.py' is the test file where data is created using make_blobs technique and clustered into groups by importing the class from 'kmeans.py' file.
